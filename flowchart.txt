1. Importing the packages
2. Exploring the dataset 
	- Diabetic Retinopathy
		- APTO
		- Messidor
		- RFMiD
3. Image processing
	- using ImageDataGenerator 
		- Re-scaling the Image
		- Shear Transformation
		- Zooming the Image
		- Horizontal Flip 
		- Reshaping the Image 
		
4. Building the model 

	- ResNet50
	- ResNet152
	- ResNet101
	- CNN
	- AlexNet
	- InceptionV3
	- InceptionResNetV2
	- Deep Residual Network
	- DenseNet201
	- DenseNet121
	- Xception

5. Training and Building the model 
6. Dumping the model

Flask Framework
----------------
 
7. Flask Framework with Sqlite for signup and signin
8. Importing the packages
9. User Upload an image for analysis
10. The given input is preprocessed and segmented 
11. The trained model is used for predicting the result
12. Final Outcome is display 



Extension
------------
In the base paper, the author mentioned to use different models for analysis the Diabetic Retinopathy dataset using different CNN models,  
However, we can further enhance the performance by exploring other techniques such Xception model for classification
from which Xception got 99% of accuracy, 
With the above As an extension we can build the front end using flask framework for user testing with authentication.
